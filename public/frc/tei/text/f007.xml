<lb/>you will see, in the declaration of your rights, Article X, that there can be no law that prohibits you from speaking and expressing your opinions, no matter how radical they may be, provided that they are not followed by consequences, and the contrary has occurred. Why have you not been made aware of your rights? Why have they not been seen to? Take them; I offer them to you with all the eagerness that a citizen who knows you can, one who knows to appreciate you for your true worth.
<lb/>I am equal, in the eyes of the law, to the most vigorous of you.
